The study of motion without consideration for the study of this motion.

Motion is: the change of an object's position over an arbitrary time period.

To study motion, we require a dependable description of position.
Such a description must have:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a constant and mutually-agreed fiducial point (origin)
    \item a constant and mutually-agreed set of axes
\end{itemize}
The assembly of the fiducial point and these axes is called a \bf Frame of Reference \rm (FoR or simply ``frame").

To locate an object in a frame requires a distance and a direction from the fiducial.

Any variable which requires a magnitude and a direction to make sense is called a $\vec{vector}$.
Example:
\begin {itemize}
    \item Force
\end{itemize}

A quantity that has only magnitude is called a scalar:
\begin{itemize}
    \item mass
    \item temperature
    \item money
\end{itemize}
