The study of motion without consideration for the study of this motion.

Motion is: the change of an object's position over an arbitrary time period.

To study motion, we require a dependable description of position.
Such a description must have:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a constant and mutually-agreed fiducial point (origin)
    \item a constant and mutually-agreed set of axes
\end{itemize}
The assembly of the fiducial point and these axes is called a {\bf Frame of Reference} (FoR or simply ``frame").

To locate an object in a frame requires a distance and a direction from the fiducial.

\subsection{Vectors}
Any variable which requires a magnitude and a direction to make sense is called a vector.
Example:
\begin {itemize}
    \item Force
\end{itemize}

A quantity that has only magnitude is called a scalar. For example: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item mass
    \item temperature
    \item money
\end{itemize}

We will denote a vector $x$ with an arrow above the letter: $\vec{x}$.

\subsubsection{Stating Vectors}
An example:
    Let us say we have a vector going on a 2D cartesian plane going from the origin
    to (3, 4). We have two basic coordinate systems to choose from:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Polar, in which we have an angle $\theta$ and a radius (magnitude) $r$.
        \item Cartesian or rectangular, in which we have an ordered pair $(x, y)$.
    \end{enumerate}

For polar form, {\bf all} $\theta's$ are referenced from the $+x$ axis.
    (Counterclockwise).
As long as $\theta$ is referenced from the $+x$ axis, your $x, y$ components
will always be correct. In polar form, the magnitude is {\bf always} positive.

\subsubsection{Other angle issues}
\paragraph{Bearings}
Some of our kinematics work will involve directions. A compass direction is
called a bearing ($\gamma$) and is measured clockwise from $+y$.
However, components of such vectors require a $\theta$ reference counterclockwise
from $+x$.
Conversion:
\[
    (\theta = 450 - \gamma) \in [0, 360)
\]
\paragraph{Types}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Absolute\hfill\\Bearing is an angle clockwise from $+y \in [0, 360)$
    \\ Very typical for professional navigation.
    \item Relative\hfill\\Suppose $\gamma = 128^{\circ}$
    
    We can also produce a bearing like this:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Choose the cardinal direction (N, E, S, W) to which this $\gamma$
        most closest points.
        \[
            S\hfill 42^{\circ} E
        \]
        \item Correct is so many degrees on either side of the chosen cardinal.
        For N or S, it is E or W, and vice-versa.
    \end{enumerate}
\paragraph{Two basic rules}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If correction is $45^\circ$ use NE, NW, etc
    \item If correction is $<45^\circ$, use trig and common sense.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\section{$\mathbb{R}^3$ - Spatial Motion}
Can use $(x, y, z)$, or $(r, \theta, \phi)$, spherical, or $(r, \theta, h)$, cylindrical.\\
$\theta \in [0, 360) \textrm{ or } [-180, 180)$\\
$\phi \in [-90, 90]$\\

\subsection{$\mathbb{R}^3$}
Above $\mathbb{R}^3$ only n-tuples are defined. We cannot visualize them and
must trust the theory. 

\subsection{Lines}

For $y = mx$, which passes through the origin, $\theta =\textrm{ constant}$.

For $y = mx + b$, $r = \frac{b}{\sin{\theta} - m\cos{\theta}}$ (derivation will
be left as an exercise to the reader.)

\section{Position Vectors($\vec{r}$)}
To analyze motion, it is sessential to locate objects in a frame. A position
vector begins at the origin and ends at the object. If the object moves
 the $\vec{r}$ instantaneously moves to follow it.

\section{Displacement($\vec{s}$)}
If an object moves, there is a straight vector that points from the start to the
finish. This is called {\bf displacement}. It is the net change of position.

In addition or subtraction, vector variable algebra is identical to $\mathbb{R}$.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Commutivity. $a + b = b + a$
    \item Associativity. $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$
\end{itemize}

If we move to point A, then to point B, we can simply move to point B.
