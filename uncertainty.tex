\section{Basic Definitions}
    \subsection{Precision}
    The repeatability of a measurement.
    \subsection{Accuracy or Error}
    The error is the difference between the true value and a measurement.
    We almost never know the true value. Accuracy is a characterization of the error. When accuracy increases, error decreases.
    
    \subsection{Reading Error}
    This is an estimate by the user perhaps based on information from the manufacturer of an instrument of precision that is typical for this instrument when used in an approved manner to its maximum capability.
    This is used to:
        
    \begin{equation}
    \sigma_x = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{k=1}^n{(\bar{x} - x_k)^2}}{n-1}}
    \end{equation}
